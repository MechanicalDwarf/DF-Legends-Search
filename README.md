# DF Legends Search
This is a minimal search tool for legends export XMLs. The main benefits over just using legends mode are that you can have this open while playing a fort and that it allows searching.
## Setup
You need Python3 to run this. You will also need the flask module and the sqlite3 module.

Then just run the flaskapp.py python file.
## Warnings
The XML reading loads the entire XML file into memory, so it uses more RAM than it should.
